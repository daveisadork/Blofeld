Blofeld is currently just a web based music server. You run it, tell it where
your music is and it makes it available for you to listen to over the web in
your browser or potentially other software or devices. It's pretty basic right
now, but it does support cover art, automatic transcoding and a few other 
things. The plan eventually is to add DAAP server capabailities and uPNP/DLNA
capabilities to basically have a be-all end-all music server.

This thing is a monster. I'm not joking. Trying to get this thing running on
your machine at this stage is just simply not recommended, but I know some
people just can't help themselves, so here's what you need to do. First things
first, save yourself a lot of pain and heartache and only attempt this on 
Ubuntu 9.10 or newer. Here's what you're going to need:

 * CherryPy 3 ( http://www.cherrypy.org/ )
 * Cheetah ( http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/ )
 * Python Imaging Library ( http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ )
 * Mutagen ( http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/ )
 * Couchdbkit ( http://couchdbkit.org/ )
 * Gstreamer ( http://www.gstreamer.net/ )
 * CouchDB ( http://couchdb.apache.org/ )

On Ubuntu, we first need to add the quodlibet-unstable PPA to get a newer
version of mutagen:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lazka/dumpingplace
  sudo aptitude update

Then we need to install all of the dependencies we can with aptitude (or
whatever you want to use):

  sudo aptitude install python-cherrypy3 python-cheetah python-imaging \
    python-cjson python-celementtree python-setuptools python-mutagen \
    python-gst0.10 couchdb

Followed by:

  sudo easy_install couchdbkit

There is a couchdbkit package for Lucid, but it appears to be broken somehow
and won't actually work, hence having to install it with easy_install.

Then you just need to run Blofeld.py. It will create a configuration file 
called blofeld.cfg. Any of the options there that you might want to change
should be pretty self explanatory.

Once you're up and running, point your web browser to http://localhost:8083/
and hopefully you'll see the web interface and be able to start browsing and
listening to music. Hopefully.

There's a very basic plugin for Rhythmbox which can add a Blofeld server
as a source. The plugin is in the extra directory, and you need to drop the
whole blofeld-rhythmbox folder into ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins and then
edit __init__.py and replace PATH_TO_BLOFELD with the path to your Blofeld.
Then write a UI to make that configurable and send me a pull request.

There's also a pretty useful JSON API that I don't feel like documenting right
now.
