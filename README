Blofeld is currently just a web based music server. You run it, tell it where
your music is and it makes it available for you to listen to over the web in
your browser or potentially other software or devices. It's pretty basic right
now, but it does support cover art, automatic transcoding and a few other 
things. The plan eventually is to add DAAP server capabailities and uPNP/DLNA
capabilities to basically have a be-all end-all music server.

Blofeld uses the following application and libraries:

 * CherryPy 3 ( http://www.cherrypy.org/ )
 * Cheetah ( http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/ )
 * Python Imaging Library ( http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ )
 * Mutagen ( http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/ )
 * Couchdbkit ( http://couchdbkit.org/ )
 * Gstreamer ( http://www.gstreamer.net/ )
 * CouchDB ( http://couchdb.apache.org/ )

If you're using Ubuntu Karmic or newer, installation is as easy as using the
PPA I have set up. You can add it by running the following at a terminal:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dwhayes/ppa

Then just update your sources and install blofeld:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install blofeld

Currently, the PPA packages install Blofeld as a system wide service. A config
file will be created automatically and placed at /etc/blofeld/blofeld.cfg
Be sure and edit this file and tell it the correct path to your music if
nothing else. Blofeld will start automatically at boot time, or you can start
it manually with this command:

    sudo start blofeld

Once you're up and running, point your web browser to http://localhost:8083/
and hopefully you'll see the web interface and be able to start browsing and
listening to music. Hopefully.

There's a very basic plugin for Rhythmbox which can add a Blofeld server
as a source. It can be found at http://github.com/daveisadork/blofeld-rhythmbox 
or you can just install it from the PPA mentioned above.

There's also a pretty useful JSON API that I don't feel like documenting right
now.
