                      *** ATTENTION WINDOWS USERS ***
================================================================================
After installing Blofeld, the first time you run it, the program will create
a configuration file and then immediately exit. If you music is not in your
"My Music" folder, you will need to edit this file and tell it where your music
is. The configuration file is called blofeld.cfg and probably located in either 
"C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Roaming\Blofeld" on Vista or Windows 7 or in 
"C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\Application Data\Blofeld" on Windows XP.

After that's all done, launch the program again and it'll start scanning your
music collection into its library. But, it will look like nothing is happening
because Blofeld has a web based interface and you've only started the server
part of the program. To see the interface, open your favorite web browser and
navigate to http://localhost:8083 and you should be able to figure things out
from there.
